FIREWALL 
What is a firewall? A firewall is an agent responsible for allowing or denying traffic based on rules. Coming to every system/agent, it can't decide the right/wrong traffic. 
Note: Here, the traffic refers to the request we are sending to the servers. 
The firewall always follows the rules and decides which traffic is to be allowed and denied. We can also add rules manually so it works the way we want. 
Example: Let's say we are using an application and I don't want the telnet port to be open and exposed to attackers, so I add rule to close the  port so one can access SO WHAT
